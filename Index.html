        <h2>About Diplomacy</h2>
        <p>Diplomacy is a classic strategy board game set in Europe before World War I. Players take on the role of one of the great powers of the time and negotiate, ally, and betray their way to victory. The game emphasizes diplomacy and strategic planning, with no luck involved.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>The game is played on a map of Europe, and each player controls one of seven great powers. The goal is to control a majority of supply centers, which are scattered throughout the map.</p>

        <h3>Phases of the Game</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diplomacy Phase:</strong> Players negotiate and form alliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Phase:</strong> Players issue orders for their units.</li>
            <li><strong>Retreat Phase:</strong> Players resolve retreats and disband units.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjustment Phase:</strong> Players adjust their supply centers based on control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Layers</h2>
        <p>Winning at Diplomacy requires both strategic thinking and the ability to negotiate. The game has 3 layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tactics:</strong> How the pieces move. Just like in chess, you have to grasp and understand how to move your pieced before you can hop to more advanced stuff.<br></br></li>
            <li><strong>Stragety:</strong> Each nation has its own way to play, so one must adjust to the nation he is playing. After understanding the <b>tactics</b> of the game, you will begin to understand how to play each nation properly, what is good what is bad.<br></br></li>
            <li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> The layer that decates everything, at least in the beginning of the game. Thechnically, if you are a very likeable individual, you can sail only on this layer and have a great time. In practice, you unless you have your strategy and tactics down, this skill alone will not make you better than other good players(though you will beat the average one).</p>
			<p>Diplomacy is the hardest skill to learn and change the older you are, as you are more set in your ways; how you talk with others. But, even if you are not the best negotiator, or the most likeble person around the block, if you got your tactics and strategy down, it will be very hard to take advatage of you, because you will have a firm understanding of what is a good deal and what is a bad one. And I think this, the abillity to distinguish between a good and a bad deal, is the first step to become a good player at the game. I have seen many times how a good player takes advatage of weaker players by offering astoundingly bad deals, and the weaker player accepting due to a failure to realize that he is being scammed.</li>

    <section id="faq">
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>What is the game objective?</h3>
        <p>The objective of Diplomacy is to control 18 supply centers on the map, which leads to a solo victory.</p>

        <h3>How many players can play Diplomacy?</h3>
        <p>For a proper game of Diplomacy, you need to have 7 players, so each player controls a country. It can be played with less than 7 technically, though the game is much less enjoyable that way, I personally wouldn't recommend it.</p>
